This project is going to require a bit more creativity. You will be creating a web page utilizing an "outside" source of information that requires fetch(). What you do with this data is up to you.

- Use Bootstrap to incorporate at least one of your HTML elements.
     - Customize your bootstrap elements to match your site. This could be as simple as changing some color or altering the structure so that it fits your sites needs.

- Pull in information from an outside source:
   - This could be from a 3rd part API, and highly encouraged.
   - If you would like to customize some of your own data, it should be stored as a JSON file within an helper folder.
          - You can use a CSV file if you're familiar with that and convert it to a JSON fairly easily.  I've included a link to a free online tool to do this.

- The user should be able to do "something" with the data provided. 
   Some options:
    - They can store it in their own list.
    - They can manipulate it so display in another way.
    - They can search it.
  Be creative in this fashion.

- When manipulating the DOM, you should be at least creating, assigning attributes, and placing elements onto the DOM for at least one section of the page.
   - If you were to update other information on the page, feel free to simply target an existing element and changing said data.

Submission:

Be sure to create a GitHub Repo for your project. Your submission should be the link to your repository.
